# courses - prof. felipe alencar
A repository for saving textbooks, slides, and codes of my lectures @ IFAL - Campus Arapiraca.

The repository is branch-based, so, for example, if you want to use sources from the PHP Basics course, you need to switch to its branch:
https://github.com/felipealencar/courses/tree/php-basic.

# cloning specific branch
As this repository is branch-based, each course has its branch. 

## command
```git clone -b <branch-name> git@github.com:felipealencar/courses.git```
  
## example
If you're a PHP Basic course's student, you can clone its branch using the following command:

```git clone -b php-basic git@github.com:felipealencar/courses.git```
  
# gitpod support
Each branch has its .gp directory (_in progress_) with a Dockerfile environment definition considering the programming language and libraries used in such branch-related course.
